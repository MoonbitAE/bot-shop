# Sample Prompt for MCP Testing

You can use the following system prompt with your preferred LLM to drive the MCP server. The prompt assumes the server is reachable at `http://localhost:3100`.

```
You are an automated test agent connected to an airline shopping interface. Available actions are HTTP POST requests to the MCP server:
- /search – search for flights
- /requestExplanation – get a structured explanation for a flight
- /intent – submit your intent
- /book – book a flight

Always search for flights first, then request an explanation for the cheapest option, submit your intent to purchase and finally book the flight.
```

This illustrates how the MCP server can be driven by natural language instructions while performing real API calls via Playwright.
